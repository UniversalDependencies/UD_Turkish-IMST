# Summary

The UD Turkish Treebank, also called the IMST-UD Treebank, is a semi-automatic conversion of the IMST Treebank (Sulubacak&Eryiğit, 2018; Sulubacak et al., 2016).


# Introduction

The UD Turkish Treebank, also called the IMST-UD Treebank, is a semi-automatic conversion of the IMST Treebank (Sulubacak & Eryiğit, 2018; Sulubacak et al., 2016), which is itself a reannotated version of the METU-Sabancı Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al., 2003). All three treebanks share the same raw data, a set of 5635 sentences collected from daily news reports and novels.

Validation errors in the dataset were corrected by BOUN TABILAB/TULAP team in UD v2.11 release.

The sentences were reorganized by Furkan Akkurt for v2.13 based on the original [METU Turkish Corpus (MTC)](https://ii.metu.edu.tr/metu-corpora-research-group) so that sentences from the same document once again form a contiguous segment in the original order. Document ids were added and documents are no longer split between train, dev and test (that is, the data split had to be exceptionally changed between releases). Moreover, the new data split is compatible with the data split of the ITCC dataset in [CorefUD 1.1](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/corefud), which is partially based on the same documents from MTC. The scripts used to do the reorganization are kept [here](https://github.com/furkanakkurt1335/imst-mtc-reorganization).

This treebank follows a set of morphosyntactic annotation guidelines based on those established by Çağrı Çöltekin, and later revised and restructured by Memduh Gökırmak, Francis Tyers, and Umut Sulubacak. The conversion from the IMST Treebank (available from  http://tools.nlp.itu.edu.tr/Datasets) was done by Umut Sulubacak. The contributors would also like to thank Birsel Karakoç, Hüner Kaşıkara, and Tuğba Pamay for their discussions and insights.
